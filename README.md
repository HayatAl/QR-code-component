## 🛠️ Built With
- **Semantic HTML5:** Using proper structure for accessibility.
- **CSS Custom Properties:** For consistent coloring and spacing.
- **Flexbox:** To perfectly center the card in the middle of the viewport.
- **Mobile-first workflow:** Ensuring the design looks great on small screens first.

## 🧠 What I Learned
Through this project, I strengthened my skills in:
- Mastering the `box-shadow` property to create depth.
- Using `max-width` to make components responsive without breaking.
- Centering elements using the classic Flexbox combo:
  ```css
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
